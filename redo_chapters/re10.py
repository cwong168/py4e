'''
This is a very tight expression that will pretty much match only the lines we are interested in as follows:
'''

# Search for lines that start with 'X' followed by any non
# whitespace characters and ':'
# followed by a space and any number.
# The number can include a decimal.
import re
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search('^X\S*: [0-9.]+', line):
        print(line)
